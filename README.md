# Instructions

## Namelist
The program reads data from `namelist.txt`. The file must include:
1. numbers of lines and rows at the beginning of the file;
2. all the names wanted, separated by `' '`, `'\n'` or `'\t'`.
3. If the program has any arguments, the output will be a table with
  width 10.
4. Additional unused seats can be add to namelist after a '----' line.

## For linux
Execute command `make exec` to generate `seats.csv`. **PLEASE** make sure you have installed gcc and have `namelist.txt` existing.
